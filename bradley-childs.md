# In Memory of Bradley Childs (XXXX-2019)

Dear community and friends,

Brad is a true friend. His personality, curiosity, motivation, and perseverance will stay with us.

## Michael McCune

I met Brad through common cause at work and formed a fast friendship that included a love of gaming and technology. He was always kind and warm towards me, and we shared many good stories. I extend my deepest condolences and would like you to know how special Brad was to our community and me personally.

Brad and I ended up on the same flight to Tel Aviv for a face to face meeting.  I recognized his voice long before I saw him.  As we deplaned I invited him to join me at the beach to burn away the jet lag.  We stopped at the mall so he could buy a complete beach ensemble (suit, hat, flip-flops, sunglasses… the works).  We smoked a cigar, had a beer, and did what two Midwesterners would no matter where they find themselves on the planet.  That day I made a friend but I never thought I’d have to say goodbye so soon. I still laugh often when his jokes come to mind and eating at a Brazilian Steakhouse will never be the same.  We all lost a good man - the genuine article.

## Tim St. Clair

I have several fond memories working with Brad.  It was always during the most chaotic and stressful moments of work Brad would be quick with a joke to make light of the situation, or to put things in perspective.  "Look at us, we’re such a bunch of whiny nerds complaining about how our roses smell!"  No matter the situation Brad always knew what really mattered, the importance of friendship, and the levity of humor.  We need more people like Brad in the world, and he will be sorely missed by all those who knew him.

I have worked with Brad for a short period time during one of OpenShift Releases. He is a true champion and always responded patiently if we need something to close on outstanding issues. I always relied on his quick responses and confident that he would get things done and always call up on him if we needed a fix for an issue that needs to be done quickly. It is a loss for his work family. My deepest condolences to the family and friends of Brad.

## Hemant Kumar

Brad was someone who believed in people. He believed in a person's ability to grow. He was fun, easy going and somehow untouched by ego. He was not only my team leader but a good friend. I am going to miss him immensely.

## Jose A. Rivera

Brad helped me through a bit of a rough patch in my career, and for that I'll be forever grateful. I was always looking forward to the next time I could hang out with him. He also made a mean batch of chili. I'll sure as heck miss both.

## Mike Barrett

Brad helped me more than I helped him.  Which is a sign of a good person.  He helped give the open source world the ability to save something and to have state; to stay on disk.  He could see his way through a technical issue better than most.  His wit was sharp and his humor...man, he made me laugh.  I will miss his laugh in this world.  You will definitely stay in my memory.  Thanks for all that you did for the world.

## Joe Beda

I didn’t have the opportunity to work with Brad. It is clear, however, that he built and sustained community by helping others.  Careerwise, I’m late to open source. It is people like Brad, however, that make it a welcoming place and show that this is all more than just a job. I wish I had a chance to get to know him.

## Erin Boyd

Brad and I knew each other briefly at IBM, and then became friends as we worked closely together at Red Hat. We often disagreed about design and implementations, but our mutual respect for one another allowed us to work through high stress situations to find the best solution. Outside of work we talked about life and I was often trying to set Brad up with friends of mine or random people I met at conferences. We joked I was his ‘wing woman.’ He was a sounding board for me, as I was for him when we would become frustrated with grind. The last time I saw Brad we were sitting outside on the patio at Barcelona telling me I needed to relax more and live in the moment. He would almost always see through the bs and call people out on it and I will miss his genuine spirit.
