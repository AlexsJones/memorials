Carolyn was the kindest person that I have had the pleasure of knowing. We started working together in 2017 and I immediately realized how fortunate I was to be able to work with her. She was generous with both her time and knowledge, and she cared deeply about the people and communities she was involved in. She always worked to build up the people around her and to identify opportunities for all and worked toward healthy and inclusive communities. We worked on a number of things together, but starting the [Porter](https://porter.sh) project with her is one of the highlights of my career. Watching her welcome and guide new contributors was so inspiring. Her dedication to the community, especially through her service on the Kubernetes Code of Conduct committee and her contributions to TAG Contributor Strategy deserve to be honored. 

Carolyn was an amazing friend, both at work and outside. 2020 was a really tough year for me personally and Carolyn was always there to check in on me and play Animal Crossing. Her friendship meant a great deal to me and I'll miss her very much. 

Rest in peace, Carolyn. ðŸŒˆ âœ¨

Carolyn is the best human I know; for me that present tense will last a long time. I met her when she was on another team working on svcat; -- a way of binding cloud services into a cluster as a crd in a coordinated way that didn't quite hit the sweet spot for one reason or another -- and her passion for making it easy to do the simple thing was acres beyond anyone I'd ever met. She'd ask me what I'd done, and why, and what was I thinking, and then she'd change it that night with an insight into what my mind wanted to do but with a modification that wasn't "for me" -- it included intuitive obviousness for others to one side of my brainspace or the other. 

Later, she joined the team I work with more directly. What I discovered was a caring, intelligent person who believed not that "I" as a dev or PM should be able to use these tools; she cared that anyone, literally anyone at all with the motivation could use those tools. And even _more_, she cared that anyone could enter the tool community and learn how to use and build and contribute and even just chat about the tools. Carolyn wasn't a gifted ux person for software; she was a gifted ux person for people. I used to think I was the most open-minded, welcoming person to new tools, new ecosystems -- the user is always right! 

No, I discovered, that wasn't enough. For her, the good-faith humans are always right. And that approach extended to every conversation I eventually had with her, about the world, this crap we call living, family, friends, you name it. I will carry Carolyn with me everywhere I go, because she fundamentally changed who I am for the better by being the model she was. It's hard to bear her loss. I sure I'm one of many.
