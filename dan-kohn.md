# In Memory of Dan Kohn

Dear community and friends,

I thought it might be a good idea for us all to gather our thoughts, memories and stories of Dan and what he meant to us in one place.

I first met Dan as I was bootstrapping CNCF and we were entering our crazy growth phase and needed to expand the team. While Dan and I didn't always agree on everything,
I had the pleasure of working with Dan on a daily basis the last few years cultivating CNCF and other LF projects. Dan was committed to building a global and diverse community, 
he always took the time to chat with community members all over the world and ensured that CNCF was using its resources to uplift the community.  We spent many hours on the road 
together away from family which can be tough for a father with young children. However, Dan always ensured that he would bring something back for the kids, or
better yet, find a way to bring them along to involve them in the community like handing our swag at our event in India earlier this year. After CNCF, Dan's next
project was establishing LF Public Health as a shared resource not just to fight COVID-19 but to combat future health crises. LFPH has already seen success and 
is bringing the spirit of open source to global health authorities. 

I will miss our fun conversations and plans... while I have lost a close friend, we have also lost a tireless champion for open source across the world.
